# Advanced Weather Data Application


## Introduction
This project outlines the creation of an advanced script/application that retrieves weather data using the Weather.com API, processes this information, and uses the OpenAI API to generate a professional email with a human-readable summary of the weather conditions. This documentation will focus on implementing this application using Python.
## Prerequisites 
**Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

**API Keys:**
Weather.com 

**API Key:** Sign up at WeatherAPI.com to obtain your API key.

**OpenAI API Key:** Obtain an API key by registering at OpenAI.

**Libraries:** Use pip to install necessary Python libraries such as requests for HTTP requests, python-dotenv for managing environment variables, and flask if implementing as a web application.
## Installation

**Environment Setup:**
Install Python and pip if not already installed.

**Install required Python libraries:**

```bash
  pip install requests python-dotenv flask
```
**API Keys:**

Store your API keys in a .env file to keep them secure:

```bash
  WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Ensure that .env is added to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked by version control.

**Project Structure:**
Create the following files and folders:
```bash
  /advanced-weather-app
    /templates
        email_template.html
    app.py
    .env
    .gitignore
    README.md
```

**Running the Application:**

Run the application with python app.py.

Access the application at http://localhost:5000/ to interact with the user interface.

## Functionalities 


**1. Weather Data Retrieval**

The primary functionality of the application is to fetch real-time weather data for a specified location from the Weather.com API (through WeatherAPI.com). This includes:


Current Temperature: Displays the immediate temperature for the requested location.



**2. Dynamic Email Generation Using AI**


Greeting: A polite introduction that might vary based on the time of day or other factors.

Weather Summary: A detailed description of the current weather conditions, structured in a human-readable format that simplifies the raw data.

Closing: A polite ending to the email, possibly offering further assistance or a pleasant comment about the weather.

**3. Error Handling**

Proper error handling ensures the application runs smoothly under various scenarios, such as:

Invalid API Keys: The application checks for authentication errors and notifies the user if there is an issue with the API keys.

Server Errors: Handles errors from the Weather.com API server, such as service unavailability or internal errors, and communicates these to the user.
## Conclusion

The Advanced Weather Data Application project stands out as a multifaceted educational and practical endeavor, blending API integration, AI-powered text generation, and web application development to deliver a functional and user-friendly service.






## Achievement 

**Effective API Integration:** 

Successfully integrating the Weather.com API and OpenAI's GPT models demonstrates a practical application of external APIs to fetch real-time data and generate meaningful content.

**Enhanced User Experience:** 

By creating a simple, intuitive user interface that allows users to input data and receive immediate feedback, the project enhances the overall user experience. Users can interact with the application to get precise weather updates and professional email summaries effortlessly.

**AI-Enhanced Communication:**

 The application showcases the innovative use of AI for generating human-readable text, making the information more accessible and professionally presented through automated emails.
